# Loan Approval Prediction

A Machine Learning web app that predicts whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on applicant financial, personal, and credit history details.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [Loan Approval Prediction](https://loan-approval-m9xu.onrender.com)
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack**: Python Â· Flask Â· Scikit-learn Â· HTML/CSS
ðŸ§  **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (best-performing classifier with a test accuracy of 99.9857%)

---

## Project Overview
Financial institutions rely on multiple risk indicators like credit score, employment type, DTI ratio, and repayment history before approving a loan.
This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline to **predict loan approval decisions automatically**.

The project includes:
* Data preprocessing & feature engineering
* Scaling of numerical features
* Encoding categorical variables
* Model selection & training
* Model serialization (`.pkl`)
* Flask-based deployment
* Frontend form for predictions
* Live cloud deployment on Render

## ML Pipeline

| Step                | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Cleaning       | Handled missing values + formatted features            |
| Feature Engineering | Created ratios, processed credit history duration etc. |
| Scaling             | StandardScaler used for numeric columns                |
| Model               | Logistic Regression trained + evaluated                |
| Saving Model        | Exported using `pickle`                                |
| Deployment          | Flask API + HTML frontend                              |

## Deployment
The app is live on **Render** and publicly accessible.
You can also redeploy anytime by connecting GitHub â†’ Render with automatic builds.

## Future Improvements
* Add XGBoost / Ensemble comparison
* User authentication / Admin dashboard
* Model explainability with SHAP
* Better UI (React / Tailwind)
* Cloud database for logging predictions
